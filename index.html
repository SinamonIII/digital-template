<h2>My Game</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A warrior with amnesia works his way through levels by rediscovering his former abilities.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should enjoy the feel of moving through the levels and working through the puzzles.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Platformer.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
<p> Controls: <p>
Q: Action Button <p>
Space: Jump / Double Jump <p>
Arrow Keys: Move Left / Right <p>

The goal of the game is to make it to the door at the end of the level.  Each chest in the 
level unlocks a new ability to help reach the door.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating the effectiveness of working through levels by learning new 
skills that are hidden throughout the level.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game is somewhat unique in that most games that use similar mechanics to control access
to various parts of a single continuous game, rather than using them in the context of short
term puzzles.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
He grew up in a small, peaceful country tucked away deep in the mountains, surrounded on both sides by vast empires that were locked 
in a seemingly never ending war.  Decades of fighting left the war-torn empires desperate for anything that might give them the upper
hand, and the introduction of guns from across the sea gave them just such an opportunity.  Unfortunately, the iron required to 
produce the guns was nowhere to be found.  That is, until it was discovered that deep in the mountains, under a small country that had 
been ignored for centuries, was enough iron to equip an entire army.  And so it began.  He rose quickly through the ranks, becoming a 
great general who was renowned for his agility and cunning on the battlefield.  For years he was able to hold off the forces of the 
great empires despite being horribly outmanned and under equipped, until one day his own lieutenant betrayed him.  His lieutenant 
struck him down with a mace to the head and threw his body into the valley.  Although he survived, he lost most of his memories, and 
no longer even remembers his own name.  You must guide him through his journey through the valley and help him rediscover his former
self in order to save his country that now faces certain destruction. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is intended for anyone who likes platformers or puzzle games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The first level that I designed is very short.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect that the best strategy will be to just explore the level and try to find new abilities to help you reach the end of the level.
